"DevTips" is a kind of series of articles that I'm planning on doing on my blog about stuff that I use everyday at work and helps me to accomplish routine tasks.

In this first article I want to talk about "git aliases" to speed up typing on terminal.

**PS**: This article works with **Linux** and **MacOS**. 

### The .gitconfig file

Git searchs ``.gitconfig`` file at your user path, to 'import' configurations.

You can find more about it at the git [documentation](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-config).

My personal aliases:

*  ``git A`` -> ``git add -A``
*  ``git st`` -> ``git status``
*  ``git cm`` -> ``git commit -m``
*  ``git cma`` -> ``git commit -am``
*  ``git b`` -> ``git branch``
*  ``git co`` -> ``git checkout``
*  ``git pl`` -> ``git pull``
*  ``git plom`` -> ``git pull origin master``
*  ``git ps`` -> ``git push``
*  ``git psom`` -> ``git push origin master``
*  ``git lg`` -> ``git log -p``

### Showtime

First of all, open a **terminal**, and get into you users folder:

```
$ cd ~
```

**Warning**: at this part, maybe you already have the ``.gitconfig`` file,  make sure to **don't override it** because it contains previous git stuff, like email and such.

If it's not there, then create the ``.gitconfig`` file:

```
$ touch .gitconfig
```

Open it with your favorite editor:

```
$ subl .gitconfig
```

Append this content on it:

{% highlight bash %}

[alias]
A = add -A 
st = status
cm = commit -m 
cma = commit -am 
b = branch
co = checkout
pl = pull
plom = pull origin master
ps = push
psom = push origin master
lg = log -p

{% endhighlight %}
