### 1 - Package Control

One way of installing Sublime Text 'plugins' or packages is by downloading files and copying them to the packages directory. However, it's very anoying to go through that process very time you want to install a new package. So there is a major package called `Package Control`: a package manager, enabling you to search and install other packages without leaving Sublime. It’s like apt-get for Ubuntu, bundler for Ruby or npm for node.js.

Follow the installation instructions [here](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) and you won’t have to install another package manually ever again.

To check if it’s working fine, press `Ctrl/Cmd` + `Shift` + `p` and type in `package control` — you should be able to view a list of options.
