If you reached this post searching about Playstation, I have two sad news for you:

* You're REALLY outdated
* This is not about Play Station AT ALL

### Moving on

One of the things that I really like about UNIX is the easiness that the core provides to create custom environments, and one of my favorites 

So how do you setup, change and pimp out Linux / UNIX shell prompt?

Most of us work with a shell prompt. By default most Linux distro displays hostname and current working directory. 

You can easily customize your prompt to display information important to you. 

PS1 - The value of this parameter is expanded (see PROMPTING below) and used as the primary prompt string. The default value is \s-\v\$ .
